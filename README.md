## Project Name: SDCN International Website.

- In this project I have made research site with the help of ReactJS.
- I have successfully developed a comprehensive website for SDCN utilizing HTML, CSS, and React.
- This website serves as a central hub for all things SDCN, showcasing upcoming events, sponsorship opportunities, and providing detailed information about the conference venue.
- Additionally, the website features a dedicated section that highlights and provides in-depth details of each webinar conducted by SDCN. With a user-friendly interface and seamless navigation.
- The website offers visitors a convenient platform to stay informed about SDCN's activities and access valuable resources related to the conferences and webinars.
- It is fully responsive too.
